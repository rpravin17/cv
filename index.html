        <h4>Biomimicry: An Overview of Structures, Designs and Materials Inspired from Nature </h4>
        <p align="justify"> Nature has always played a vital role in the evolution of life forms. The design of products in accordance with natureâ€™s design,<br>
          popularly known as biomimicry, had played a vital role in pushing the technology and product effectiveness to the next level. Humans have long <br>
          sought to mimic not just the design, but also the methodology adopted by certain animals. For example, the walking technique of vertebrates has <br>
          been effectively mimicked for a quadruped robot to make a system more efficient by consuming less power. Thus indirectly, nature acts as a driving <br>
          factor in pushing technological growth. <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/104418"> link </a></p>

        <h4> Corrosion & joining issues of aluminium alloys in aircraft industries</h4>
        <p> The conventional aircraft and its various sub-assemblies are manufactured using different materials having <br>
          variable physical and chemical properties which are selected for the specific purpose or function that the component is <br>
          meant to serve. The paper serves as a guide on these materials and their properties corresponding to the requisite function <br>
          it has to serve. Joining issues of aluminium alloys in aircraft industries are also handled effectively in the present paper. <br>
          The library of materials are tabulated systematically and their failures due to corrosion and corresponding applications in <br>
          aircraft manufacture are discussed.</p>

        <h4> Process Capability & Fascinating applications of Friction Stud welding</h4>
        <p> In earlier days, welding only involves joining two metals of same kind and dissimilar metals were usually joined by fasteners.<br>
          Friction Stud welding is a true engineering marvel of making welds between dissimilar metals without any melting or fillers involved.<br>
          The friction stud welding doesn't involve heat generation from electricity and it is purely based on friction. Besides these facts the <br>
          friction stud welding has numerous advantage and applications. This paper focuses on the process of stud welding, application and its limitations. <br> </p>

        <h4> Simulation of Transient Liquid Phase Bonding Process and the Influence of Interlayer Thickness</h4>
        <p> Ceramic/metal joints are possible with solid state joining techniques. Transient liquid phase bonding is a solid state joining process <br>
          which is choice process. In this paper, numerical simulation of TLP bonding of ceramic/metal is done by Finite Element simulation. <br>
          The finite element analysis of the TLP process provides the temperature and residual stress distribution during the bonding.<br>
          Aluminium sheet as interlayer having high wettability is used. Transient thermal analysis is performed and discussed.

        <h4>Effect of inter layers in joining dissimilar metals </h4>
        <p> In the recent decade, dissimilar metal joints are much sought in many critical industrial application. But joining of dissimilar metals pose many challenges <br>
          because of the difference in chemical, thermal and mechanical properties of metals. <br>
          Joining of dissimilar metals using interlayers by friction stud welding is an ideal solution.<br>
          The strength and toughness of the weld can be further improved by introducing a layer of material in between the dissimilar metals. <br>
          Interlayers are small thin sheet of material of metal used in friction welding of metals. This interlayer has typical effect on the welds and the found <br>
          to produce desirable effects on the welded joints. This paper focuses on the various effects of interlayers on welding of dissimilar metals.

        <h4>A survey on characterization of natural fibers</h4>
        <p>
          Natural fibers are highly preferable for diverse engineering applications because of their significant advantages over synthetic fibers. No wonder, today scientists <br>
          are very much interested in identifying those materials which are renewable, easily available, green, environmentally friendly,<br>
          biodegradable materials that are very essential for our future generation. Natural fiber composites are emerging out as a lucrative choice <br>
          when compared to synthetic and metal matrix composites owing to its significant advantages. <br>
          The focus of this article is to give a detailed account on characterization methods and comparison of the available natural fibers. <br>
          Procedures of chemical treatment, XRD analysis, Thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy are discussed and natural fibers are compared.<br>
          The present article would be helpful in selection of correct fiber for the intended application out of green composites.

        <h4> Stir casting & processing of aluminum matrix composites </h4>
        <p>
          Aluminium Matrix Composites have potential applications in Aerospace and Automotive industries. Their light weight structure, high corrosion resistance and superior mechanical properties <br>
          make them a choice candidate in higher end applications. Aluminiummatrix composites materials can be produced by many different techniques. <br>
          By altering the manufacturing method, the processing and the finishing, as well as by the form of the reinforcement components added, it is possible to obtain different characteristic profiles,<br>
          although the same composition and same amounts of the components are involved. This paper focuses on the processing of various aluminium alloy compositesb <br>
          by varying different parameters using stir casting technique. Because of the presence of ceramic reinforcements, processing these metal matrix composites is challenging <br>
          and requires better alternative techniques.
